# Project Title

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to extract valuable insights and patterns using statistical and data analysis techniques. The project aims to answer a specific research question and present the findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Dataset

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a comprehensive dataset containing information on more than 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide between 1970 and 2017. It includes details about the time, place, weaponry, casualties, and other information related to these attacks. This dataset is frequently used in terrorism research and is available on Kaggle.

## Data Analysis

- 27% null values were identified in the dataset.
- The data was categorized into major and minor attacks based on the number of casualties.
- Major attacks: Those with more than 10 casualties.
- Minor attacks: Those with less than 3 casualties.
- Analysis was performed to examine trends and patterns in the number of major and minor attacks over the years.

## Scatterplots

- Scatterplots were created to visualize the trends in major and minor terrorist attacks over time.
- Both major and minor attacks showed an overall increasing trend, with a significant spike in recent years, which is a cause for concern.

### Major Attacks Trend:

- The plot showed a gradual increase in major attacks from the 1970s until the early 2000s, followed by relative stability.
- However, recent years saw a sharp increase in major attacks, with a significant spike in 2014 and 2015.

### Minor Attacks Trend:

- The plot displayed a steady increase in minor attacks from the 1970s until the early 2000s, followed by relative stability.
- Recent years also witnessed a sudden surge in minor attacks, similar to the trend in major attacks.

## Regression Analysis

Regression analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between the year and the number of major and minor attacks. The following code was used for the analysis:
